### Docker Boxes

I'm going to collect definitions for several boxes I use in this repository. There is some script to help me build and connect to them.

#### Build

* `./build.sh` to build the devbox.
* `./connect.sh` will connect to the devbox

#### Configuration

* Several thing are related to my setup, creating symbolic links to repos where I have configuration.

### Boxes

#### 01-devbox

I started with this configuration. It contains: tmux, neovim, java, clojure, ruby, go setups and goodies.
